Status:


### 1. COMPLETELY DONE ‚úÖ

1. Core Data Models:
   - GameCharacter, GmCharacter, Petition, PetitionHistory, PetitionMemo classes
   - Template model and related structures
   - Category model
2. Database Infrastructure:
   - DbContext implementation
   - Connection pooling
   - Repository pattern implementation
   - All core database operations for petitions and templates

### 2. WORKING BUT NEEDS TESTING üîÑ

1. Database Operations:
   - All ExecuteStoredProcAsync implementations
   - Repository methods
   - Connection pooling behavior
2. Core Services:
   - QuotaService
   - GmStatusService
   - TemplateService
3. Resilience Patterns:
   - CircuitBreaker
   - RetryPolicy
   - ResiliencePolicy

### 3. PARTIALLY DONE üî®

1. Network Layer:
   - Packet handling structure is in place but some handlers need implementation
   - Session management exists but needs more error handling
   - Authentication flow needs completion
2. Services:
   - PetitionService has core functionality but needs more features
   - AssignLogic needs integration testing
3. UI:
   - MainForm basic structure exists but needs more features
   - Console output management is basic

2. **Session Management**
   ```csharp
   File: Infrastructure/Network/Sessions/GmSession.cs
   - Missing: Complete session state management
   - Missing: Session recovery mechanisms
   ```

3. **UI Implementation**
   ```csharp
   File: UI/Forms/MainForm.cs
   - Basic implementation done
   - Missing: Complete status display
   - Missing: Configuration interface
   ```

### 4. MISSING IMPLEMENTATIONS ‚ùå

1. Complete World Server Communication:
   - Full packet handling for world server
   - World state synchronization
2. Notification System:
   - Real-time updates between GM and World servers
3. Complete UI:
   - Full administrative interface
   - Monitoring and statistics
4. Testing:
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Load tests
5. Logging:
   - Comprehensive logging system
   - Log aggregation and analysis
6. Deployment:
   - Deployment scripts
   - Configuration management
   - Environment-specific settings


### 5. NEXT STEPS (Priority Order) üéØ

1. Critical Infrastructure:
   ```csharp
   // File: Core/Models/AssignLogic.cs
   // Complete the assignment logic implementation
   public class AssignLogic
   {
       // Add missing methods and proper error handling
   }
   ```

2. Network Implementation:
   ```csharp
   // File: Infrastructure/Network/WorldService.cs
   // Complete world server communication
   public class WorldService
   {
       // Implement remaining packet handlers
   }
   ```

3. Session Management:
   ```csharp
   // File: Infrastructure/Network/Sessions/SessionManager.cs
   // Add comprehensive session tracking
   public class SessionManager
   {
       // Add session monitoring and cleanup
   }
   ```

4. Testing Framework:
   ```csharp
   // File: Tests/Integration/PetitionServiceTests.cs
   // Create testing infrastructure
   public class PetitionServiceTests
   {
       // Add comprehensive test cases
   }
   ```

5. Monitoring and Logging:
   ```csharp
   // File: Infrastructure/Logging/LoggingService.cs
   // Implement comprehensive logging
   public class LoggingService
   {
       // Add structured logging and metrics
   }
   ```
